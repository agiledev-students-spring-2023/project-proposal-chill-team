# üßä Project Chill 
     
A fun way to go on dates!     
          
## ‚ùì What and Why?
Oftenly, in a busy city like New York, it may be hard to meet new people and hence, many individuals will rely on dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc... to go on dates. However, these dates end up going straight to the point... and does not allow matched couples to truly get to know one another. Not to mention, it is completely up to the matched pair to decide their date activities, which can be hard for many. Chill, however, offers a new, exciting and spontaneous way to go on dates and meet your new (potential) soulmate. Chill will be a mobile app that forms around the idea of matching with another person, based on accepting a date activity and time slot rather than accepting a person. Chill will drift more away from the conventional online dating procedure but instead offers matched pairs an exciting way to get to know one another by experiencing an activity with one another.

## üë§ For Whom?
Chill will be for those who are looking for an exciting and spontaneous way to go on dates or even to meet new friends by enjoying an activity together!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How?
Chill will firstly register and create a profile for its users. Once a profile is complete, it will ask it's users whether they want to propose an activity at a given time slot or match with other's pending activities. In proposing an activity, users will have the option to create a new activity or choose a suggested/existing activity (given by Chill). Once the activity is proposed, it will reach a pending state waiting for another user to match with that activity. If another user searches to match an activity and successfully matches with a proposed activity, they will then have access to this other person's profile where they can then choose to withdraw their match, but ONLY after having a conversation with that person. After conversation state, it is then up to the users to go on the date (or not). Chill's advantage will be an expanding database of date activities (created by its users).

## üíº Scope
     
### Too Easy? Def Not
- Will need to create a user system      
- Will need to sort/organize/manage activities      
- Will need to create a chat system
- Will need an algorithm that queries based on pending state activities      
- Will need a live system that tracks and stores user choices
- Many More Features      
### Too Hard? Maybe
- Many features unclear how to implement      
- Tech Stack may be new for many students
